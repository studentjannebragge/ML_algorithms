## Explanation

### Training the Model

The `train` method calculates the prior probabilities \( P(C) \) for each class and the likelihoods \( P(x \mid C) \) for each feature given a class using Laplace smoothing.

### Making Predictions

The `predict` method computes the posterior probabilities \( P(C \mid x) \) for each class, and returns the class with the highest posterior for each instance in the test set.

### Example Dataset

The `X_train` matrix contains two features: a binary feature (0/1) and a categorical feature ('S', 'M', 'L').  
The `y_train` vector contains the class labels ('T' and 'F').  
When you run this code, it will train the Naive Bayes classifier and make predictions for the test instances in `X_test`.

### Next Steps

You can modify this implementation for different types of data, like continuous features, by adjusting the likelihood calculation.  
If you'd like to handle text data, you can tokenize the text and convert it into a numerical form (such as a bag-of-words representation).
